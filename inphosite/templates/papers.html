    <div class="abstract">
        <p> The unique convergence of humanities scholars, computer scientists,
librarians, and information scientists in digital humanities projects 
highlights the collaborative opportunities such research entails. The digital 
humanities aspire to create, maintain, and deploy high integrity metadata that 
are derived from the activities and feedback of domain experts in the 
humanities, to support scholarly activities in the humanities which meet the 
high standards of academic peer review. Unfortunately, the relatively limited 
human resources committed to many digital projects for the humanities have led 
to unwieldy initial implementations and underutilization of semantic web 
technology, with the result that most projects in the digital humanities are 
standalone projects whose data cannot easily be integrated with others. In 
addition to the barriers arising from idiosyncratic implementations, the 
difficulties of integrating data from multiple sources are compounded by the 
use of standards that serve one particular purpose well but do not facilitate 
other kinds of scholarly activities, often making the combination of resources 
from different projects laborious and expensive. Thus, much of the potential 
for collaboration in the digital humanities still remains to be unlocked.</p>

    <div class="abstract">
        <p> Ontology evaluation poses a number of difficult challenges 
requiring different evaluation methodologies, particularly for a "dynamic 
ontology" representing a complex set of concepts and generated by a 
combination of automatic and semi-automatic methods. We review evaluation
methods that focus solely on syntactic (formal) correctness, on the 
preservation of semantic structure, or on pragmatic utility.  We propose two 
novel methods for dynamic ontology evaluation and describe the use of these 
methods for evaluating the different taxonomic representations that are 
generated at different times or with different amounts of expert feedback.  
The proposed "volatility" and "violation" scores represent an attempt to merge 
syntactic and semantic considerations. <em>Volatility</em> calculates the 
stability of the methods for ontology generation and extension. 
<em>Violation</em> measures the degree of "ontological fit" to a text corpus 
representative of the domain.  Combined, they support estimation of 
convergence towards a stable representation of the domain. No method of 
evaluation can avoid making substantive normative assumptions about what 
constitutes "correct" representation, but rendering those assumptions explicit 
can help with the decision about which methods are appropriate for selecting 
amongst a set of available ontologies or for tuning the design of methods used 
to generate a hierarchically organized representation of a domain.</p>

        <p>The application of digital humanities techniques to philosophy is 
changing the way scholars approach the discipline. This paper seeks to open a 
discussion about the difficulties, methods, opportunities, and dangers of 
creating and utilizing a formal representation of the discipline of 
philosophy. We review our current project, the Indiana Philosophy Ontology 
(InPhO) project, which uses a combination of automated methods and expert 
feedback to create a dynamic computational ontology for the discipline of 
philosophy. We argue that our distributed, expert-based approach to modeling 
the discipline carries substantial practical and philosophical benefits over 
alternatives. We also discuss challenges facing our project (and any other 
similar project) as well as the future directions for digital philosophy 
afforded by formal modeling.</p>

        <p>The next generation of online reference works will require 
structured representations of their contents in order to support scholarly 
functions such as semantic search, automated generation of cross-references, 
tables of contents, and ontology-driven conceptual navigation.  Many of these 
works can be expected to contain massive amounts of data and be updated 
dynamically, which limits the feasibility of "manually" coded ontologies to 
keep up with changes in content. However, relationships relevant to inferring 
an ontology can be recovered from statistical text processing, and these 
estimates can be verified with carefully-solicited expert feedback. In this 
paper, we explain a method by which we have used answer set programming on 
such expert feedback to dynamically populate and partially infer an ontology 
for a well-established, open-access reference work, the Stanford Encyclopedia 
of Philosophy.</p>

    <p class="summary"><strong>2007</strong> &mdash; Describes the dynamic ontology design process and the J-weight measure of term relatedness.  <a href="#JCDL2007" onClick="showAbstract(this)"><strong>&laquo;show abstract&raquo;</strong></a> </p>
    <div class="abstract">
        <p>The successful deployment of digital technologies by humanities
scholars presents computer scientists with a number of unique sci- entific and
technological challenges. The task seems particularly daunting because issues
in the humanities are presented in abstract language demanding the kind of
subtle interpretation often thought to be beyond the scope of artificial
intelligence, and humanities scholars themselves often disagree about the
structure of their disciplines. The future of humanities computing depends on
having tools for automatically discovering complex semantic relationships among
different parts of a corpus. Digital library tools for the humanities will
need to be capable of dynamically tracking the introduction of new ideas and
interpretations and applying them to older texts in ways that support the needs
of scholars and students.</p>

    <p>This paper describes the design of new algorithms and the adjustment
of existing algorithms to support the automated and semi-automated management
of domain-rich metadata for an established digital humanities project, the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Our approach starts with a "hand-built"
formal ontology that is modified and extended by a combination of automated and
semi-automated methods, thus becoming a "dynamic ontology". We assess the
suitability of current information retrieval and information extraction methods
for the task of automatically maintaining the ontology. We describe a novel
measure of term-relatedness that appears to be particularly helpful for
predicting hierarchical relationships in the ontology. We believe that our
project makes a further contribution to information science by being the first
to harness the collaboration inherent in a expert-maintained dynamic reference
work to the task of maintaining and extending a formal ontology. We place
special emphasis on the task of bringing domain expertise to bear on all phases
of the development and deployment of the system, from the initial design of the
software and ontology to its dynamic use in a fully operational digital
reference work.</p>
