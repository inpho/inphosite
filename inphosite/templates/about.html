<h1>About the InPhO</h1>

<p>The InPhO is an attempt to model the discipline of philosophy. Our
approach leverages expert knowledge by augmenting it with machine reasoning,
greatly reducing the need for expensive "double experts" trained in both
philosophy and computational ontology. The primary source of text data and
domain experts is the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu">Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy</a> (SEP). With over 1 million weekly article downloads, the SEP
is the leading digital humanities resource for philosophy, maintained by over
${people} volunteer authors and subject editors. Consisting of over ${entries}
articles and ${words} words, the tremendous depth of the encyclopedia makes it
impossible for any one person to have expertise over the whole domain,
necessitating the creation of a useful organization scheme to provide better
editorial control and content accessibility. At the same time, the
comprehensive richness of the SEP makes it a reasonable proxy for the 
discipline of philosophy as a whole.</p>

<p>Our approach utilizes an iterative three-step process, which we have termed <i>dynamic
ontology</i>, to create a taxonomic representation of philosophy:
<ol class="numbered">
    <li><strong>Data mining</strong> - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        techniques are used to generate statistical hypotheses about the
        relations among various topics in the SEP. </li>
    <li><strong>Expert feedback</strong> - These hypotheses are evaluated
        by domain experts through online interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine reasoning</strong> - The feedback is combined
        with the statistical measures as a knowledge base for our machine
        reasoning program, which uses answer set programming to output a
        taxonomic view of the discipline.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Further details on dynamic ontology can be found on the <a
href="/papers">Articles and Papers</a> page.</p>

<p>InPhO does not assume that a single, correct view of the discipline is possible, but
rather takes the pragmatic approach that some representation is better than no
representation at all. However, even if other projects do not agree with our
taxonomic projections, our statistical data and expert evaluations may still be
useful. By exposing our data at all three steps through an easy-to-use <a
href="/docs">API</a>, we encourage other projects to discover alternative ways
to construct meaningful and useful representations of the discipline.
Additionally, by offering an open platform, we invite other projects to
contribute relevant data and expert feedback to improve the quality of the
service.</p>

dynamic ontology generally, we invite you to contact us at <a
